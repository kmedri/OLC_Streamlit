st.markdown('## Project Overview')
st.markdown('Over the last few years improvements to roads in the UK have been implemented across the country in order to create a safer roading system with some great effect.')
st.markdown('The number of RTCs or road traffic collisions are reported to be in decline.')
st.markdown('However there still seems to be a rise in severe and fatal collisions.')
st.markdown('Using datasets from the Department of Transport, we hope to be able to uncover the probability of the severity of a collision.')
st.markdown('Using Data Science we will develop and deploy a machine learning model in an effort to predict RTC severity:')

st.markdown('The project has been broken down into six pipelines:')
st.markdown('1. Data Engineering')
st.markdown('2. Group 1 Predicting RTC Severity')
st.markdown('3. Group 2 Geospatial Heatmap')
st.markdown('4. Group 3 Time Series Analysis')
st.markdown('5. Group 4 Vehicle Analysis and Predictions')
st.markdown('6. Solution Deployment')
st.markdown('**Pipeline 1** prepares the datasets for groups 1 - 4')
st.markdown('**Pipelines 2 - 5** will run concurrently and have three tasks:')
st.markdown('- EDA')
st.markdown('- Feature Engineering')
st.markdown('- Model Development and Evaluation')
st.markdown('**Pipeline 6** will bring together the models and create the solution to be deployed.')
st.markdown('Each Pipeline will produce a Jupyter notebook, based on the findings of each of the team members notebooks, for their task.')
st.markdown('The task lead will then produce a combined notebook, being passed on to the next task until completion of all three tasks.')
st.markdown('The notebooks will be published on the Omdena Liverpool GitHub site.')
